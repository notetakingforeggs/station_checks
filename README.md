# station_checks
This is a repo for the station checks flask app i am making. Current focus is on the local scraper branch. This set up is to do most if not all of the actions on the back end, which is fine for now but feels like it means that there is some reliance on me / server operator to link devices, and initiate updates if they stop for whatever reasons.

### future plans
Transfer files from prvious repo that has the actions all available to the client, such that the website could be easily sent to another nextike branch and they could link their device, and it would populate a map for wherever etc.
